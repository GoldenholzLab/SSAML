## Simulation

Several simulated datasets are generated for
* different numbers of features;
* different levels of class imbalance;
* different levels of class mislabeling.

We assume we know
* the ground truth accuracy for classification = 1 - class mislabeling percent.

Each condition we generate 2 versions with different random seeds.
